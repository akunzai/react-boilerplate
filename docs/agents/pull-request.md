# Pull requests

**This file is English throughout**, sample blocks included, whatever
language the repo chose for its requests.

Write PR titles, descriptions, and comments in **English**.
**Git commit messages are English**, imperative, subject under 72
characters — they live in history and get searched by tooling.

## Preparing

- Work on a feature branch. Never prepare a request from the default branch.
- Use a concise descriptive title with no Conventional Commit prefix,
  because one request may carry more than one kind of change.
- Link the issue in the description (`Closes #<n>`). If
  there is no tracked issue, drop the section — never leave an unlinked
  `Closes #` or empty issue marker.
- **Do not open a request, draft included, without the developer asking.**

## Description shape

1. A plain-language opening: what changed and why, as a reviewer who did
   not write it would need it.
2. A visual the forge renders inline, chosen by what changed:

   | Change | Visual |
   | --- | --- |
   | Flow or state transition | Mermaid `flowchart` / `stateDiagram` |
   | Cross-service or API interaction | Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` |
   | Data model | Mermaid `erDiagram` |
   | Appearance | Before/after screenshots |
   | Multi-step interaction | Short recording |
   | Backend or library only | None; test output instead |

   Pair before and after. At most one diagram unless it is such a pair.

   In a Mermaid label, write a path parameter as `:id`, not `{id}` — `{}`
   opens a rhombus node and fails the parse — and break lines with `<br/>`,
   not `\n`, which is not a line break inside a quoted label.

   Upload the file with the repeatable `--attach` flag —
   `gh pr create --attach './after.png#After'`.
   Alt text follows the path after `#`, and a path the body already
   references as `![alt](./after.png)` is rewritten to point at the
   uploaded asset. Only when capture is genuinely impossible, leave a
   named placeholder comment.
3. A collapsed technical trailer holding implementation notes, verification,
   and lessons learned. Skip affected paths — the forge's own diff view
   already shows those.

**No personally identifiable information in any attachment**, whatever
you end up attaching. `verification.md`'s capture rules say what that
means here.

## Tests land with the behaviour

- **Product logic**: `src/components/`, `src/api/`, `src/hooks/`. A change here lands with its tests in the
  same request.
- **Exempt**: documentation, CI configuration (`.github/`), scripts, i18n locale files (`src/i18n/locales/`), and
  dependency bumps with no behaviour change.
- **Structurally untestable** code — configuration classes, all-static
  factories — is declared in the description, naming what covers it instead.

No coverage threshold. The reviewer judges whether the new behaviour is
actually exercised.

## Review readiness

Nothing unverified enters review. Two orders satisfy that:

- **Default**: verify locally per `verification.md`, then open the
  request with the evidence.
- **When only a deployed environment can verify** — see the list in
  `verification.md` — open the request as a draft
  (`gh pr create --draft`), let the pipeline deploy, verify against it,
  attach evidence citing the pipeline or deployment id and the commit
  SHA, then mark it ready.

State in the description which paths were verified and which were not,
with the reason.
